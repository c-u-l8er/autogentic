## üöÄ Running Examples

### Recommended: Use the Example Runner
```bash
# The example runner ensures Autogentic system is properly initialized
mix run run_example.exs examples/basic/hello_agent.exs
mix run run_example.exs examples/coordination/deployment_team.exs
mix run run_example.exs examples/reasoning/decision_maker.exs
mix run run_example.exs examples/real_world/data_pipeline.exs

# List all available examples
mix run run_example.exs
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start IEx with full Autogentic system
iex -S mix

# Then load and run examples:
iex> c "examples/basic/hello_agent.exs"
iex> HelloAgentExample.run()
```

### Direct Execution (Advanced)
```bash
# Note: Requires manual system initialization
# Use example runner instead for better experience
cd examples && elixir run_example.exs basic/hello_agent.exs
```

## üìñ Learning Path

We recommend following this learning path through the examples:

1. **Start with [hello_agent.exs](basic/hello_agent.exs)** - Learn basic agent concepts
2. **Explore [effects_showcase.exs](basic/effects_showcase.exs)** - Understand the effects system
3. **Study [decision_maker.exs](reasoning/decision_maker.exs)** - Learn reasoning capabilities
4. **Try [deployment_team.exs](coordination/deployment_team.exs)** - See multi-agent coordination
5. **Examine [learning_agent.exs](basic/learning_agent.exs)** - Understand adaptive behavior
6. **Build with [data_pipeline.exs](real_world/data_pipeline.exs)** - Apply to real-world scenarios

## üîß Prerequisites

To run these examples, you need:

- Elixir 1.15+
- Erlang/OTP 24+
- Autogentic v2.0 dependencies (run `mix deps.get`)

## üí° Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Effects System
- **Sequence Effects**: Execute effects one after another

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent won't start:**
```bash
# Make sure you have started the Autogentic application
iex -S mix
```

**Effects not executing:**
```bash
# Check that the effects engine is running
Autogentic.Effects.Engine.start_link([])
```

**Reasoning sessions failing:**
```bash
# Ensure the reasoning engine is available
Autogentic.Reasoning.Engine.start_link([])
```
